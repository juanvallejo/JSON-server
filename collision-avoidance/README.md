Collision Avoidance
===================

This is where we are going to focus on collision avoidance. I have made some tools to use for accessing the obsticles database in the Competition server.

Accessing the competition server

Just follow this:
```bash
./accessCServer

// Then write:

.tables

//to view the tables

```
